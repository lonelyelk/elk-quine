# Quine exercise

Create a quine from scratch with running elk inrton:

```
      ^^..^^           ^^..^^ 
   _____ U         _____ U    
 ~(  _  /    =>  `(  _  /     
   || ||           // \\      
   ^^ ^^          ^^   ^^     
```

Saved evolution to see how I was figuring stuff out. I had no prevoius experiance in creating
quines. History goes:

```
quine.rb => quine.lesseval.rb => quine.arr.rb
```

You can run and observe running elk with:

```
$ ruby runner.rb
```
